This workshop lesson is an introduction to making interactive data visualizations in Python. Learners will create a new environment using [conda][anaconda], wrangle data into the proper format using [pandas] library, create visualizations using the [Plotly][plotly] Python library, and display these visualizations and create widgets using [Streamlit][streamlit].
